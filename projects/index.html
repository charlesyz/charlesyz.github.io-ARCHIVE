            <h3 id="ezjigsaw">EzJigsaw IOS app</h3>
            <p>  EzJigsaw is an interactive game where users can create dynamic and customizable jigsaw puzzles using their own photos.

                <li><a href="https://github.com/charlesyz/Ez-Jigsaw">Source Code is on my Github</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p> While not my first app, EzJigsaw is my biggest and most challenging project to date. After independently learning the Swift programming language in two weeks,  I spent four months in the summer of grade 11 creating the app. After a lot of hard work and determination, my efforts were rewarded. On October the third, 2017, EzJigsaw was released onto the IOS App store. Over 200 people downloaded it on the first day. Since then, users from Russia to Japan have download it to enjoy fun and relaxing jigsaw puzzles. </p>

            <h3 id="tapemeasure">TapeMeasure Android App</h3>
            <p>  TapeMeasure is an android app where users can use their phone to mimic a real tape measure. The app uses the built-in accelerometer to track your phone's movement. Simply slide your phone across a smooth surface, and the app will tell you how long far you've moved! Unfortunately, due to technology limitatues with the accuracy of the accelerometer and noisy data, the App was not published. The best accuracy I could achieve was about +-5%, even with calibrations and noise-reduction.</p>

            </ul>
            <p> TapeMeasure was my first big project. In the summer of grade 10, I learned Java and began work on the app. Originally, I had very big plans for the app. Not only did I want the accelerometer funcitonaly, I also wanted to use the phone's camera to measure visual lengths using focal data. I learned a lot about not only coding, but also project and time management. Being unable to realise my grand plans really hammered home the importance of a concrete schedule and a specific project outline. </p>

            <h3 id="mazebot">MazeBot</h3>
            <p> Built with the help of Miasya Bulger, MazeBot, also named "Beep Boop", is a autonomous maze solving robot. Using an ultrasonic sensor to detect maze walls infront of it and Infrared Sensors to follow the maze grid, MazeBot is able to navigate and solve any custom 4x4 maze. The maze walls are made of lasercut MDF boards, and the robot uses a custom depth-first-search algorithm. Mazebot is based on the Arudino Uno Microcontroller.</p>

            <h3 id="tetris">Tetris</h3>
            <p> Tetris was my first programming project, and my summative project for ICS3U (Grade 11 Computer Science). The game is a clone of the classic tetris game, complete with highscores, music, and sound effects. It is built in C using Allegro.</p>

            <h3 id="mathapps">Math Apps</h3>
            <p> In 2017, I began  a new line of Math Web-apps in partnership with the Lisgar Math Department to help improve Math Education. The first app is a Quadratic Equation solver. It's purpose is to demosntrate the importance of setting the quadratic equation equal to a variable, instead of just leaving it hanging. </p>

            <h3 id="mazebot">Lisgar Game Jam</h3>
            <p> Founded in 2017 with the help of the Lisgar Computer Science Department, the Lisgar Game Jam is a free weekend event where students have 20 hours to design, program, and test a computer game according to a surprise theme. In 2017, the theme was "The Wall". The game jam was founded with the purpose of introducing more students to Computer Science. In the weeks leading up to the event, there are custom button sales and workshops in processing, a java based language. At the event, there is a host of programming experts to help you out incase you're stuck. The event is a great and fun way to take your first steps into computer science. </p>
